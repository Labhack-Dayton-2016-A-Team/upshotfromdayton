<h2>About</h2>
Team UpShotFromdayton has been working hard over the past few days to develop a method for translating foreign language photos or pdfs.
<h2>Notes</h2>
The primary difficulty is determining which documents from the field need to be translated. It is far from optimal to waste the time of a limited pool of translators by having them translate field documents which do not need to translated. This is where Project Upshot from Dayton has decided to focus its efforts.
<h2>Build Notes</h2>
Our build is comprised of the following important key concepts. To effectively determine which documents need to be translated by a human translator, the soldier or data gather takes a photo of the field document. The field document is processed locally on the device to determine relevance. If the document is determined by the algorithm to be mission critical, the document is  automatically delivered to Command Center (CC) where a translator may translate the image and return an accurate translation and account for local dialects. If the document is determined by our app to be not critical to the mission, the document is not sent to CC and the soldier notified that the document is not relevant. It is important to note that our app does allow the soldier to overwrite this function and send the document to CC.
